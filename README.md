# Bountyful Sushi

## Introduction

What is Bountyful Sushi?

It's a website ran by an admin user who is a world famous sushi chef, now retired. He still wants to make sushi, but can no longer get the ingredients himself. I made him this app to set up a way for him to get his sushi by asking people, regular users, to catch the fish for him. When they do catch the fish, they can then purchase sushi from the site with fake currency that they've been awarded.

## Purpose and Motivation

When designing this app, the main goal I had was to have two types of users, regular users and admin users. This goal had been on some of the back-end projects of the NSS course, but my teams and I never got around to completing it.

## How to Use

I am looking to deploy this app in the future, as there are many, many steps to set it up on your own device. If you want to see the site in action currently, I've done a demo of it in video form, which can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/uiaTIZ55f8I?list=PLvvquqSQ_WqTvNIWWiTB1XukPrJSddXop

## Development

Bountyful Sushi was developed with several languages. The front-end uses primarily React and JavaScript, and the back-end is almost entirely C# and uses an SQL Database.
